# Installation
npm i && node .
<br>
Make sure to put your domain in ./config/domains.txt. This can be multiple domains, you can also block ips in ./config/ipblocks.txt

<br>
I recommend having at least a server of 1GigaBytes up & down, 4GB RAM, 6CPU cores. <br>
When the attack is this big I recommend using load balancing, as an example you can use CloudFlare DNS send multiple A records to different servers, all servers will receive the visitors / requests.
